Carbon Monoxide, CO (RGB visualization and transparency with dataMask)

This image, obtained from the Copernicus Sentinel-5 satellite, presents a spatial distribution of carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations, using RGB visualization techniques and transparency to denote the presence and intensity of CO in the atmosphere. Although this image does not directly depict cloud cover or shadowing relevant to solar panel efficiency, the data it provides can be crucial for environmental monitoring, which indirectly affects solar energy generation. High concentrations of atmospheric pollutants can reduce the effectiveness of solar panels by scattering and absorbing sunlight that would otherwise be converted into energy. Therefore, monitoring pollution levels can be valuable in selecting locations for solar installations, aiming for areas with lower atmospheric pollution to maximize solar panel performance. Additionally, understanding the distribution of such pollutants can assist in assessing potential environmental impacts and the feasibility of clean energy projects, including solar power.
