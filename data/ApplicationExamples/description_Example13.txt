Sulfur Dioxide, SO2 (minQa=20 applied, streched values)

When considering solar power generation, SO2 concentrations can have indirect effects:

Atmospheric Absorption: SO2 in the atmosphere can lead to the formation of aerosols that scatter and absorb sunlight, potentially reducing the solar irradiance reaching the Earth's surface. This can decrease the efficiency of solar panels.

Cloud Formation: SO2 can act as a nucleating agent for clouds, which may lead to increased cloud cover. Clouds can cast shadows and reduce the amount of sunlight available for solar panels, affecting power generation.

Air Quality: High levels of SO2 can affect air quality, which is a consideration for the placement and maintenance of solar panel installations. Poor air quality might necessitate more frequent cleaning and maintenance of solar panels to ensure optimal operation.

For power generation, satellite data is utilized in the following ways:

Site Selection: By analyzing patterns of SO2 concentration, regions with consistently lower levels can be identified as more suitable locations for solar farms to maximize sunlight exposure.

Operational Forecasting: Predictive models can use satellite data on SO2 levels to forecast potential reductions in solar power generation due to increased atmospheric absorption or cloud formation.

Maintenance Scheduling: Understanding the patterns of SO2 distribution can also help in planning maintenance schedules for solar panel cleaning, ensuring that the solar panels operate at peak efficiency, especially in areas prone to higher pollution levels.
